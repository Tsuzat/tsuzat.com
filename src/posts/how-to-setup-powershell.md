# Introduction

A good looking terminal and [shell](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)>) is a jewellery for programmers.
Ricing is a popular term in the world of linux OS. but since we're in holy grains of windows, we'll try to do the best to make the terminal and shell look good.

> Warning: Note that this is not a guide for windows ricing

# Installations

Before we get started, let's download and install few tools.

- [**Powershell 7**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MZ1SNWT0N5D?ocid=pdpshare) - Install it from microsoft store itself.

- [**Wezterm**](https://github.com/wez/wezterm) - Wezterm is a gpu accelerated terminal emulator written in `Rust`. You can either install it by following official installation guide or you can install it using [scoop](https://scoop.sh). I have already explained the process of installing scoop and wezterm in [_my post_](/blogs/how-i-setup-windows).

```sh
# run following commands in powershell or cmd
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install wezterm
```

- [**Starship**](http://starship.rs) - Starship is a shell prompt. It'll help us display many useful information in shell(see image below)

![starship preview]({starship})
_Preview of starship, I personally configured_

To install starship, you need to run following command.

```sh
scoop install starship
```

- [**Nerd Fonts**](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)- Download and install nerd font. I'll be using `FiraCode Nerd Font` as my default font across the platform.

# Set up

Once the installation is completed, Let's set up everything one by one.

### Setting up Wezterm

Wezterm provides the explained configuration in their [docs](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/config/files.html).
But, you're here for a simple and straightforward explaination. Don't worry; I got you. To configure _wezterm_,
you need to make a file in location `$HOME/.config/wezterm/wezterm.lua`. Windows do have `.config` folder in `$HOME`
so you just need to make a `wezterm` folder in `$HOME/.config`. The structure should look like this

```text
$HOME
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ.config
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄwezterm
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ colors
            ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ catppuccin-mocha.toml
            ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NeoSolarized-dark.toml
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wezterm.lua

```

> Info: The colors folder will hold the colorschemes for the wezterm

Now, let's set up `wezterm.lua`. I have gone with following configurations.
You can copy this code but I'd recommend to understand it first.

```lua{f[wezterm.lua]}
local wezterm = require "wezterm"

return {
  default_prog = {'pwsh.exe' }, -- Powershell
  font = wezterm.font 'FiraCode Nerd Font', -- Nerd Font which fallbacks to JetBrains Mono
  font_size = 14,
  hide_tab_bar_if_only_one_tab = true,
  tab_bar_at_bottom = true,
  window_background_opacity = 0,
  -- Available "Acrylic", "Mica", "Tabbed", "Disable" and "Auto"
  win32_system_backdrop = "Tabbed",
  initial_rows = 30,
  initial_cols = 100,
  color_scheme = 'NeoSolarized Dark',
  color_scheme_dirs = { "~/.config/wezterm/colors" },
  window_padding = {
    left = 2,
    right = 2,
    top = 0,
    bottom = 0,
  },
  default_cursor_style = 'SteadyBar',
}

```

### Setting up starship

For the configuration of `starship`, we can refer to official [docs](https://starship.rs/config/).
But, I'm here to make the initial configuration simple. The extension of that can be limitless.
By default, all the configuration for _starship_ lies in file `$HOME/.config/starship.toml`

```
$HOME
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ.config
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄstarship.toml
```

Inside this file, you can put following code.

### Setting up Powershell

The location of powershell configuration file may vary depend upon your system.
This is why I'll recommend you to make a smart decision. We'll make a file `user_profile.ps1`
and make the default powershell configuration file refer to `user_profile.ps1`.

I'll create it in a `$HOME/.dotfiles/powershell/user_profile.ps1` folder but you can create it anywhere,
as long as you can find and edit it.

Once the file is created, I'll open default configuration file of powershell by using following commands.

![powershell preview]({powershell1})
_powershell 7 recommended to run all commands_

> Warning: Run this command using powershell 7 only, to avoid conflicts.

```sh
notepad $PROFILE
```

Inside the Nodepad, you need to add following line,
`. $env:USERPROFILE\.dotfiles\powershell\user_profile.ps1` (see image)

![powershell config preview]({powershell2})
_put the code in file and save using **Ctrl + S**_

Now, we're ready to edit `user_profile.ps1` as per our need. Before, goind to the
editing the `user_profile.ps1` itself. Let's install few packages.

```sh
# terminal icons provides the icons in terminal itself.
# gsudo let us run Elevated commands like `sudo` in linux
# scoop-completion provides auto complete in scoop commands on pressing <TAB>
scoop install terminal-icons gsudo scoop-completion

# Provides the history of commands
Install-Module -Name PSReadLine

```

Once, everything is installed, let's put the following code in `user_profile.ps1`.
Try to understand each line of code.

```sh{f[user_profile.ps1]}
# icons for powershell terminal
# scoop install terminal-icons
Import-Module Terminal-Icons

# For Elevated Command
# scoop install gsudo
Import-Module gsudoModule

# history of the commands
# Install-Module -Name PSReadLine
Import-Module PSReadLine

Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView

# Vim Like KeyBinding for Next and Previous History Selection
# Using `Ctrl+j` for Next selection and `Ctrl+k` for Previous selection
# Remove following commands if you want to use just arrow key for navigation
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key Ctrl+j -Function HistorySearchForward
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key Ctrl+k -Function HistorySearchBackward

# Alias
Set-Alias -Name "vim" -Value "nvim"
Set-Alias -Name "v" -Value "nvim"
Set-Alias -Name "g" -Value "git"
Set-Alias -Name ".." -Value "cd.."
Set-Alias -Name "lg" -Value "lazygit"

# Useful functions
function cd...  { Set-Location ..\.. }
function cd.... { Set-Location ..\..\.. }
function ll { Get-ChildItem -Path $pwd -File }

# Reload this config file
function reload-profile {
  & $profile
}

# very powerful function to kill processes by process name
function pkill($name) {
  Get-Process $name -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process
}

# function to grep the process by name
function pgrep($name) {
  Get-Process $name
}

####### Utilities #######

# function to create a new git repo
function giac($Branch = "master", $Message = "Initial Commit") {
    git init -b $Branch
    git add .
    git commit -am $Message
}
# function for quick git add, commit and push
# by just providing the Message
function gacp ($Message){
  git add .
  git commit -am $Message
  git push -u
}

# function to emulate linux `which` command
# this outputs the application path
function which ($Command) {
  Get-Command -Name $Command -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
    Select-Object -ExpandProperty Path -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

# Function to delete Item(s) and Directory(ies)
function delete ($Item){
  Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $Item
}

# Function to emulate
function time ($Command){
  $executionTime = Measure-Command { Invoke-Expression -Command $command }
  Write-Host "Execution Time: $($executionTime.TotalMilliseconds) milliseconds"
}

# install scoop-completion
#`scoop install scoop-completion`
# enable completion in current shell, use absolute path because PowerShell Core not respect $env:PSModulePath
Import-Module "$($(Get-Item $(Get-Command scoop.ps1).Path).Directory.Parent.FullName)\modules\scoop-completion"

cls # clear any output after loading the config

# install starship
# `scoop install starship`
Invoke-Expression (&starship init powershell)
```

All Done. Now you can open `wezterm`. Install `neofetch` using following command,

```sh
scoop install neofetch
```

then run the command,

```sh
neofetch.exe
```

You will see something like this.
